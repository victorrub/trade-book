# Trade Master

Application focused to identify the categories of trades in a bank´s portfolio based on value and client´s sector.

## Main Issue

A bank has a portfolio of thousands of trades and they need to be categorized. A trade is a commercial negotiation between a bank and a client.
Each trade has a value that indicates the transaction amount in dollars and a text indicating if the client´s sector is "Public" or "Private".
