# Trade Book

## Overview

Trade book is an application focused to identify the categories of trades in a bankÂ´s portfolio based on value and clientÂ´s sector.

Imagine that a bank has a portfolio of thousands of trades and they need to be categorized. A trade is a commercial negotiation between a bank and a client.

Each trade has a value that indicates the transaction amount in dollars and a text indicating if the clientÂ´s sector is "Public" or "Private".

Tradebook identifies the category of each trade based on the registered business rule ðŸ˜€
